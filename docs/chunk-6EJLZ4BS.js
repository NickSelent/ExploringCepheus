As a Referee, you, not the rulebooks, are the final arbiter in your game. This is a serious responsibility, but also a great freedom: the freedom to create and run an entertaining game that suits your needs and the needs of your group.

You can certainly plan everything out for your session, to the degree with which you are comfortable. However, at some point in time, whether intentionally or accidentally, you are going to have to improvise a scenario that you did not plan in advance. Maybe the mercenary rolled poorly in that last combat, dying during the previous encounter, and the corporate executive that hired the adventurers only made the deal with him. Perhaps the party decides to pursue another adventure, which you had not yet prepared, half-way through the current one, based on a clue they found in the second encounter of the evening.

"),t(),a(26,"p"),e(27,' A common misconception exists that improvisation during a game and preparation for a game are two opposed approaches. To the contrary, the more efficiently you prepare for the game, the easier it will be for you to improvise and "wing it" during actual play. The key to efficient preparation is not deciding ahead what the characters will do (leave that to the players), but rather creating material which would both allow the players to do exciting things and which will allow you to easily set up challenges, encounters, NPCs, locations and plots that will fit the flow of the game.

Whenever an idea for whatever part of your game strikes your mind, jot it down in the notebook.

Organize a binder at home (or a directory on your computer), with different partitions (or electronic files) for NPCs, locations, creatures, locations and plot hooks. Each item (NPC, location etc) you develop shouldn't be long, a few sentences per item will work in most cases (remember that most stats for a character or creature will fit in a small paragraph, if not a single sentence.) Keep these well-organized and these could be used whenever you need them in-game or in a short-term preparation for the game.

That way, when the characters ask a random citizen for their name, you can easily choose one from your list, provide it to the group and then cross it off.

Reserve Very Difficult (-4) and Formidable (-6) for very special circumstances, such as attempting the near impossible.

Circumstances making the task easier or harder to accomplish, like a favorable or unfavorable environment or a particularly demanding task, modify the Difficulty.
