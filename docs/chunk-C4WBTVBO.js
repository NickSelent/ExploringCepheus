It carries a Gas Turbine engine, Code G, and a Mole propulsion system, Code G, giving a top speed of 100 meters/hour, a cruising speed of 75 meters/hour and an Agility DM of -4. 0.68 kiloliters of hydrocarbons support the power plant for 2 days. This vehicle is equipped with Basic controls, a Class II communication system (Very Distant), Standard sensors (DM -2), and a Model 1 computer. There is one extended cockpit. The tunnel boring machine is equipped with hostile environmental protection and 10 days of basic life support. Cargo capacity is 14.79 kiloliters. The vehicle requires a crew of one: the pilot. The vehicle can carry up to one other passenger in the extended cockpit. The vehicle costs KCr282.650 (including discounts and fees) and takes 36 hours to build.
