The typical war can be created with three opposing sides, even if one of them is simply a large band of pirates with goals at odds with the two "official" sides. Creating three elements vying for the same goal creates a greater degree of dynamic complexity, allowing for adventures that explore the different relationships between the three elements without reducing the conflict to a simple "black-and-white", two-dimensional confrontation.
