The typical war can be created with three opposing sides, even if one of them is simply a large band of pirates with goals at odds with the two "official" sides. Creating three elements vying for the same goal creates a greater degree of dynamic complexity, allowing for adventures that explore the different relationships between the three elements without reducing the conflict to a simple "black-and-white", two-dimensional confrontation.

Characters exposed to a radiation weapon will receive a one-time dose of radiation. Entering a radioactive area or being exposed to a leak or solar flare will cause exposure each round or hour. Every time a character experiences exposure to radiation, they must check to see if they've come down with radiation sickness, as outlined on the Radiation Effects table.
